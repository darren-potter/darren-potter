Hey there! Darren here.

I am a Senior Web Developer with key focus on the various parts of the backend sides
of applications. I can do logic, but I struggle with the pretty side of things. I am
currently employed at [easyfundraising](https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk) making
things there as amazing as I can and seeing so many charities and other good causes
raising funds to keep themselves going and to continue doing good in the world.

Right now I am working on reaching out to the wider community by posting about the
things we do. It's early days so I can't promise they'll be amazing posts, but they
will be posts. Feel free to follow my via my links below.
